# (Rshiny) Webserver

## Background

This PoC is to develop what is likely to be a common requirement within Higher Education as researchers increasingly want to make their data available through a web service.  It could equally be a LAMP stack but I am working with a researcher who is using RShiny already.  This is also a common scenario outside of HE so expect that it would be relatively simple to develop from existing DevOps materials.
I envisage spinning up an appropriate VM instance, setting up the RShiny/LAMP stack, downloading the code base from a repository and connecting to the data on Blob/Bucket storage, possibly setting up some logging on some DB/noSQL provision?

# Sprint objectives 
* Create a learning path for spinning up an [RShiny server](http://myyearindata.com/2018/running-your-own-shiny-server-on-azure/)
* Create Blueprints and learning path to ensure security: data, access and cost
